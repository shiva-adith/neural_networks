# neural_networks
 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify images into Rock, Paper or Scissors.

## Network Architecture<br>
I have used **Tensorflow** and **Keras** here to create the neural networks. There are three sections to the project:
<ol>
 <li> A simple Neural Network that produces the least accurate results. This serves as teh benchmark for the rest of the project.</li>
 <li> A simple Convolutional Neural Network.</li>
 <li> Hyperparameter tuned CNN which produces the best accuracy.</li>
</ol>

## Dataset<br>
<ul>
 <li>The dataset <em><strong>rock_paper_scissors</strong></em> is loaded from the <strong>tensorflow_datasets</strong> library</li>
</ul>
